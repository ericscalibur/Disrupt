# Department Deletion Safety Feature

## Overview
This feature prevents accidental data loss when deleting departments that still have employees assigned to them. It provides a confirmation dialog and safely removes both the department and its employees when confirmed.

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Deletion Attempt
When a user tries to delete a department:
- Server checks if the department has any employees
- If no employees: Department is deleted immediately
- If employees exist: Server returns a confirmation requirement

### 2. Confirmation Dialog
If employees are found, the user sees a detailed confirmation dialog:
```
This department still has 3 member(s):

• John Doe (john@company.com)
• Jane Smith (jane@company.com)  
• Bob Wilson (bob@company.com)

Deleting this department will also delete these employees. 
Are you sure you want to delete this department and its employees?
```

### 3. Confirmed Deletion
If user confirms:
- All employees in the department are removed from `users.json`
- Department is removed from `departments.json`
- Success message shows count of deleted employees
- UI refreshes to reflect changes

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side (server.js)
**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/departments`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "department": "Engineering",
  "confirmDelete": false
}
```

**Response (Requires Confirmation):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "employeeCount": 3,
  "employees": [
    {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@company.com"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@company.com"}
  ],
  "message": "This department has 3 employee(s). Deleting this department will also remove these employees."
}
```

**Response (Successful Deletion):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "departments": ["HR", "Marketing"],
  "deletedEmployees": 3,
  "message": "Department deleted along with 3 employee(s)."
}
```

### Client-Side (script.js)
**Function:** `removeDepartment(department, confirmDelete = false)`

**Flow:**
1. First call with `confirmDelete: false`
2. If `requiresConfirmation` returned, show confirmation dialog
3. If confirmed, call again with `confirmDelete: true`
4. Handle success/error responses
5. Refresh UI components

## Safety Features

### Data Validation
- Department name validation (required, non-empty string)
- Employee data validation before displaying confirmation
- Error handling for malformed server responses

### User Experience
- Clear confirmation message with employee details
- Employee count and names displayed
- Success messages indicate number of employees affected
- Automatic UI refresh after deletion

### Error Handling
- Network error handling
- Invalid department name handling
- Server error response handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing UI functions

## Usage Examples

### Deleting Empty Department
```javascript
await removeDepartment("Marketing");
// Result: "Department 'Marketing' removed successfully!"
```

### Deleting Department with Employees
```javascript
await removeDepartment("Engineering");
// Shows confirmation dialog
// If confirmed: "Department deleted along with 3 employee(s)."
```

## Files Modified

### Server-Side
- `server.js`: Updated `DELETE /api/departments` endpoint
  - Added employee checking logic
  - Added confirmation parameter handling
  - Added employee deletion when confirmed

### Client-Side  
- `script.js`: Updated `removeDepartment()` function
  - Added confirmation flow handling
  - Added safety validation
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Added UI refresh logic

### Styling
- `style.css`: Ensured confirmation dialogs display properly

## Benefits

1. **Data Safety**: Prevents accidental loss of employee data
2. **User Awareness**: Shows exactly which employees will be affected
3. **Informed Decisions**: Users can see consequences before confirming
4. **Atomic Operations**: Department and employee deletion happens together
5. **UI Consistency**: All department lists refresh automatically

## Edge Cases Handled

- Empty department names
- Non-existent departments
- Malformed employee data from server
- Network errors during deletion
- Missing UI refresh functions
- Multiple departments with same name (prevented by validation)

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Delete empty department** - Should delete immediately
2. **Delete department with 1 employee** - Should show confirmation
3. **Delete department with multiple employees** - Should list all employees
4. **Cancel deletion** - Should not delete anything
5. **Confirm deletion** - Should delete department and employees
6. **Network error during deletion** - Should show error message
7. **Invalid department name** - Should show validation error

This feature ensures that department management operations are safe, transparent, and user-friendly while maintaining data integrity.
